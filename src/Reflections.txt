To avoid similar problems to the ones stated above in the future:- 
	More in depth documentation given.
	For and if loops are written with comments giving parameter and expected output.
	Type mismatch should be kept note of while writing code.
	Private shouldn't be used for all variables.
	Tasks should be ordered by their place in the actual code.
	The style guidelines should always be followed when writing code.
